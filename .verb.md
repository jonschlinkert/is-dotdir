## Usage

To be considered a dot **directory**:

- the path must contain a dot that is at the beginning of the string or following a slash 
- the next character after the dot must not be another dot
- one or more non-slash characters must follow the dot
- a slash must follow after at least one non-dot, non-slash character

To check for dot **files**, use [is-dotfile][] instead.

```js
var isDotdir = require('{%= name %}');

isDotdir('a/b/c/.gitignore');
//=> false

isDotdir('a/.git/a/b/');
//=> true
```
